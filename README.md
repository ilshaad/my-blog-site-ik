## What is the app about?

The app is a blog site. I have learnt a lot from the web community, and I believe in giving back. So I write blog articles in the hope that it will help other web developers, who are struggling with certain topics that I come across.

## Main technologies I used in the app:

- React
- Typescript / Javascript
- Next.js
- Jest
- React-Testing-Library
- Bootstrap / React-Bootstrap
- PWA
- Docker
- etc...

## Some key points about the app:

- Test on every pages.
  - Using Jest and React-Testing-Library.
  - API and unit testing.
- Mobile first approach, design ranging `320px-1600px`.
